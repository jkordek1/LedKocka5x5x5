## What is it?
Just another 125 LED cube powered by ATmega16 microcontroller and HC595 shift registers.

## Video
Video of it in action: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpSFf-s8Nvs

## Problems
Project BOM is not optimal. Due to electronic components shortage, "on-hand" available components were used.
